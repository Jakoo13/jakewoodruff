                    My name is Jacob Woodruff. I grew up in Kentucky my whole life. In September of 2018, when I was 25, I moved to Queen Creek, AZ. In September 2019, after living here for a year I began teaching myself how to code. I would squeeze in as many hours as I could to my already busy schedule, usually after work and on weekends. When I say I don't do anythings besides work, I am not exaggerating. Eventually I went down to working my day job Mondays-Wednesdays, just to pay the bills, and spending the entire Thursday-Sunday coding. I started out reading books on HTML/CSS, then using resources like Udemy.com to do follow-along projects, and code hands on. After I had a good grasp on HTML/CSS and CSS Grid I started Javascript. JavaScript, as some of you know, is way more complex. Currently I am working on my skills with Ajax calls, and handling form data. My near term plans are to continue teaching myself JavaScript and JavaScript frame works like React, as well as other technologies that a Full-Stack Developer knows how to implement. Next on my to-do list is React, backend code: either nodeJS or PHP to handle form-data and where to send it, as well as databases using MySQL. My long term goals are to become a seasoned, and well-able Web-developer first. Then, I definitely have strong interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and large data.

                My first real job, aside from my highschool, Lake Cumberland marina dock-hand jobs, was Denney Marine. Denney Marine is a business in Albany, Kentucky owned by my uncle Leon Denney. It is a very successful, award winning Supra and Moomba Wakeboard boat dealer as well as a Seadoo Jetski dealer of over 20 years. I routinely was working on and closing 15k dollar Seadoo deals to over 150k dollar new boat deals. In the offseason I bought, sold, and traded used cars for this business full time. I was a leading salesman but as with any small business I did everything, from secratary work like filtering phone calls, writing up bill-of-sales, accepting payments and transferring titles, to mechanic work like servicing jet skis, and working on cars and boats. A huge portion of my sales job was creating and posting ads online on websites like Craigslist, Ebay, and Boattrader, then handling all of the call/text inquiries on my ads. I was also in charge of updating our website and other web presences monthly. During my time at this job I gained a large amount of experience in customer service, problem solving, sales, and online advertising. <a href="https://www.denneymarine.com" class="link" target="_blank">Denney Marine Website</a>.

                    I moved to Queen Creek, AZ just to try something new. I wasn't fulfilled in small town Kentucky. It was one of the best things I have chose to do, because I love it here. I currently work for a local, successful Audio/Video company called Sound Effects located in Mesa, AZ. I am a <em>Team Lead</em> of the Pre-Wire section. I am experienced in everything from running wire in new and remodel homes, to installing home theater and security systems. I pride myself in being a great leader. I obtained this position because I understand what it takes to get a team of guys to get the job done as fast and as clean as possible. This starts with first having a ruthless work ethic myself, being the hardest worker in the room, and leading by example. This work ethic most definitely carries over to my programming as well. To check out the company here is a link to the

                My name is Jacob Woodruff. I grew up in Kentucky my whole life. In September of 2018, when I was 25, I moved to Queen Creek, AZ. In September 2019, after living here for a year I began teaching myself how to code. I would squeeze in as many hours as I could to my already busy work schedule, usually after work and on weekends. Eventually I went down to working 3 days a week at my day job, just to keep paying the bills, then spend the other 4 days of the week coding. I started out reading books on HTML/CSS, then using resources like Udemy.com and Youtube to do follow-along projects, and code hands on. After I had a good grasp on HTML/CSS and CSS Grid, I started to understand Javascript, which is where I am at currently. My near term plans are to continue teaching myself JavaScript and JavaScript frame works like React, as well as other technologies that a Full-Stack Developer knows how to implement. Next on my to-do list is React, backend code like PHP to handle form-data and where to send it, as well as databases using MySQL.

                <p class="main-text">
                My first real job, aside from my highschool, Lake Cumberland marina dock-hand jobs, was Denney Marine. Denney Marine is a business in Albany, Kentucky owned by my uncle Leon Denney. It is a very successful, award winning Supra and Moomba Wakeboard boat dealer as well as a Seadoo Jetski dealer of over 20 years. I routinely was working on and closing 15k dollar Seadoo deals to over 150k dollar new boat deals. In the offseason I bought, sold, and traded used cars for this business full time. I was a leading salesman but as with any small business I did everything, from secratary work like filtering phone calls, writing up bill-of-sales, accepting payments and transferring titles, to mechanic work like servicing jet skis, and working on cars and boats. A huge portion of my sales job was creating and posting ads online on websites like Craigslist, Ebay, and Boattrader, then handling all of the call/text inquiries on my ads. I was also in charge of updating our website and other web presences monthly. During my time at this job I gained a large amount of experience in customer service, problem solving, sales, and online advertising. <a href="https://www.denneymarine.com" class="link" target="_blank">Denney Marine Website</a>.

                    I moved to Queen Creek, AZ just to try something new. I wasn't fulfilled in small town Kentucky. It was one of the best things I have chose to do, because I love it here. I currently work for a local, successful Audio/Video company called Sound Effects located in Mesa, AZ. I am a <em>Team Lead</em> of the Pre-Wire section. I am experienced in everything from running wire in new and remodel homes, to installing home theater and security systems. I pride myself in being a great leader. I obtained this position because I understand what it takes to get a team of guys to get the job done as fast and as clean as possible. This starts with first having a ruthless work ethic myself, being the hardest worker in the room, and leading by example. This work ethic most definitely carries over to my programming as well.
